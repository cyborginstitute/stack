Hello,

I'm sorry to hear that you want to leave the list. If there's anything that we can do or could have done to make the list better for you, I would very much appreciate and enjoy the feed back. Now here's the technical bits: 
 
To unsubscribe send an email to glb-knit-unsubscribe@groups.queernet.org from the address you wish to subscribe with the text:

unsubscribe glb-knit [your email address] [your name] 

in the body of the email. And that's it. Maybe we'll see you again some day. 

Cheers, 

sam 

(glb-knit administrator)
