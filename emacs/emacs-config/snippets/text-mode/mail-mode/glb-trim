Hey, 

Just a friendly reminder: I've been catching up and the list lately, and I've been told to be on the lookout for posts that have too much *quoted* material from previous posts (that text from the message[s] that comes up when you hit reply), and I noticed that you had a few posts that were pretty lengthy. 

Quoting helps give posts context, but we all get the same email so a lot of quoting can grow teious. I know I go off about this a fair bit, but if you can try and trim it to the relevant contextual content, that would be great. I think the concern is that there are a lot of people who are easily overwhelmed by high volume, and by being considerate of those folks, we can make the list even more inclusive. 

Thanks for hanging around in any case. 

Cheers,
sam
