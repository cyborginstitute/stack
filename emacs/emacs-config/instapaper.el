;; Instapaper.el is a set of functions to add urls to instapaper, a
;; simple tool to save web pages for reading later. Instapaper is at
;; https://www.instapaper.com/. This is not an official instapaper
;; client.

;; Requirements:
;; url.el, found in Emacs 22 or later.
;; w3m.el is recommended but not required.

;; Installation
;; Put instapaper.el somewhere on your load-path
;; (require 'instapaper)
;; M-x customize-group instapaper
;;
;; Recommended keybindings:
;; (define-key global-map "\C-ci" instapaper-add-at-point)
;; (define-key identica-mode-map "i" 'instapaper-add-at-point)
;; (define-key w3m-mode-map "i" 'instapaper-add-from-w3m)
;;
;; Note that passwords are not required on instapaper. You must have
;; an instapaper account ot use this package; it will not create one
;; for you.
;;

;; Use
;; To save a url to read later, use M-x instapaper-add,
;; instapaper-add-at-point, or instapaper-add-from-w3m.

;; Roadmap
;; 0.8:      Add urls successfully
;; 0.9:      More convenient functions for adding url at point or url of
;;           current buffer.
;; 1.0:      Better error handling
;; post-1.0: Add reading functions, maybe.
