Cyborg Institute License Statement
==================================

This document outlines the terms the terms and approach to copyright
licensing for Cyborg Institute projects. The Institute consists almost
entirely of intellectual output (i.e. texts, software, code, and
documentation,) constructed in the context of an open community
exchange. This licensing statement serves to make explicit principals
that lead to the licensing choices for Institute projects, as well as
to provide a single source for the `cyborginstitute.org`_ site
licensing statement.

.. _`cyborginstitute.org`: http://cyborginstitute.org/

Principal
---------

The content and product of the Cyborg Institute are: 

- a community effort, rooted in open conversations, methods, and
  collaboration.

- respectful and supportive of the freedom and rights of users and
  contributors.
  
- intentionally sustainable and built to support itself and endure
  into the future independent of specific leadership and technology.

In light of these goals, institute projects tend to prefer licenses
on the `copyleft <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft>`_ spectrum,
although some projects use more permissive terms when
appropriate.

Terms
-----

See relevant :file:`LICENSE` or :file:`COPYING` in the repository of
the project for explicit terms, and licensing. For
`cyborginstitute.org`_, and unless otherwise specified, you may
receive all content under the terms of a license that, **both**:

- allows you to copy, modify, and redistribute all content or software
  as long as you also provide access to the source for your changes.

- ensures that anyone that receives the content or software from you
  will have the same rights as you had when you received the work. 

These terms do not constitute license. Choose an acceptable license
from the following list.
