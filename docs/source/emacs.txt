===========
Emacs Stack
===========

Overview
--------

Emacs is an incredibly useful piece of software, but the default
configuration is difficult to use, and makes it difficult to
appreciate the capabilities of the program, understand how to
customize the environment, or even use the software effectively for
basic text editing tasks. Once you become familiar with Emacs and have
begun to customize it yourself, the rational for the "no default
configuration," becomes clear, but it's difficult to get to this point
and there's no good reason to leave would-be emacs users to fend for
themselves.

The "emacs-stack", then, provides a good example configuration that
users may find helpful as an example of how to manage a large and
complex emacs configuration, and a set of good, working defaults
derived from `tycho's <http://tychoish.com>`_ working
configuration. In contrast to some other attempts to provide a good
introductory default to emacs, this "distribution," of emacs code does
not attempt to package emacs itself, nor does it attempt to deliver an
emacs experience designed to be easy to learn for users of another
system or environment. Rather, the emacs-stack presents a faithful
example of a real "working" emacs configuration.

The distribution contains a directory named ``emacs/`` that contains
all emacs lisp files and a ``makefile`` that manages installation,
removal, and byte-compilation of the emacs configuration. Most of the
files in this distribution are publicly available and freely licensed
packages, but there are a number of files that configure key-bindings,
configure variables and settings, and provide some custom "glue
functions" that are original to this configuration.

Release

The latest release is always available at `http://download.cyborginstitute.net/emacs-config.tar.gz`_. 

You can always view past archival releases by visiting
`http://download.cyborginstitute.net/`_, where releases reflect the
full commit hash of the `stack project`_ `git repository`_ (`github`_).

Points of Interest
------------------

- ``tycho-`` files contain specific configuration and integration
  of the emacs packages into the "stack." Of particular note are
  ``tycho-emacs.el`` and ``tycho-init.el``: ``tycho-emacs.el``
  contains the core configuration, while ``tycho-init.el`` guides the
  initialization process for running multiple instances of emacs'
  daemon mode with different configurations. 

- ``tycho-keybinding.el`` holds most of the keybindings. Review this
  file before using emacs-stack to become familiar with the interface. 

- ``config/`` the files in config, provide the "gateway" in the
  initialization process to all of the ``tycho-`` files. All the files
  reflect a hostname for one of your systems, and make it possible
  have machine specific configuration. The ``makefile`` will a file
  from this directory to your systems ``~/.emacs`` file.

- ``makefile`` will byte-compile *all* files in the distribution,
  create a host specific file in the ``config/`` directory, archive
  your current ``~/.emacs`` file, and create a symbolic link to your
  new emacs config.

Setup and Customization
-----------------------

See the :doc:`downloads page <downloads>` for a link to the latest
tarball with a copy of the emacs-stack release. Download this file,
using the following command: 

.. code-block:: sh

   cd
   wget http://download.cyborginstitute.net/emacs-stack.tar.gz

Then extract the archive: 

.. code-block:: sh

   tar -xxv emacs-stack.tar.gz
   
Then run the ``make`` process to install the new configuration. 

.. code-block:: sh

   make install
   
When complete the script will archive your existing ``~/.emacs`` file
in your home directory and ``~/.emacs`` will be a symbolic link that
points to a file in ``emacs/config/``, and all emacs lisp files will
be byte-compiled.

You can edit any of the emacs lisp files as ended for your
configuration. Run the following make operation at any point after
changing the lisp files to update the byte-compiled files:

.. code-block:: sh

   make byte-compile

for customization and components of the emacs-stack.

Internal Overview
-----------------

Many of the files included in the distribution are third-party
libraries and scripts. The files in the ``config/`` directory, and all
files beginning with ``tycho-`` provide the integration and originate
with this distribution. 

.. note:: 

   There is no guarantee that any of the emacs lisp included in this
   package is: bug free, up to date, or unavailable through other
   means.

The following list introduces the core components of the emacs stack,
that create the entire experience

.. index:: config/hostname.el
.. describe:: config/hostname.el

   Contains all machine specific configuration. Ideally, these files
   are all unique to the machine, but there is some duplication in
   practice. 
   
   Your user account's ``~/.emacs`` file should be a symlink to this
   file.
   
   Do not insert lisp into this file unless it causes an inter-system
   compatibility issue.

.. index:: tycho-init.el
.. describe:: tycho-init.el

   This file controls the initialization process, and grows out of a
   need to maintain two or more emacs daemon instances on the same
   system *with* different desktop (i.e. state) systems.

.. index:: tycho-emacs.el
.. describe:: tycho-emacs.el

   This is the core configuration file, and most of the other
   ``tycho-`` files are required from this file. At some point in the
   distant history all of the ``tycho-`` files *were* in this file,
   now ``tycho-emacs.el`` contains ``(require)`` calls and sets a
   number of variables and settings.

.. index:: tycho-display.el
.. describe:: tycho-display.el

   Contains all visual modifications to emacs' display and font
   selection. Implemented as a series of functions the ``init`` file
   requires this file and then calls one of these functions during the
   display process. 
   
   Alternatively, you may, use your ``~/.Xdefaults`` file with the
   following lines to control your Emacs appearance a bit more
   cleanly: 
   
   .. code-block:: ini
   
      emacs.menuBar:off
      emacs.FontBackend:xft
      Emacs.font: inconsolata:pixelsize=14:antialias=true:hinting=true
      Emacs.pane.menubar.font: inconsolata:pixelsize=14:antialias=true:hinting=true

.. index:: tycho-deft.el
.. describe:: tycho-deft.el

   Provides some fairly significant wrappers around `Deft
   <http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/>`_, similar to the code in
   ``tycho-ikiwiki.el``.

.. index:: tycho-keybindings.el
.. describe:: tycho-keybindings.el

   In most cases, the ``tycho-keybindings.el`` file specifies all
   custom keybindings that don't directly relate or depend on other
   code. For instance org-relgated bindings are stored in
   ``tycho-org.el``.

All other ``tycho-`` files contain simple wrappers and configuration
around otherwise unmodified lisp files and packages obtained from
third party sources. Comments may be sparce, but feel free to open an
inquiry on `lists.cyborginstitue.net
<http://lists.cyborginstitute.net/>`_ for a documentation and/or
commenting enhancement.
